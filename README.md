# 📌 Project: Terminal-Based Issue Tracker CLI
## Tech Stack:
* Language: Golang (or Node.js)
* Database: SQLite (local) or PostgreSQL (remote sync)
* CLI UI Framework: bubbletea (for Golang) or ink (for Node.js)
* Storage & Sync: File-based storage (YAML/JSON) for offline mode + database sync

## 🚀 Key Features:

### 🔹 Core Functionality
* Create, update, delete issues (with priority, status, tags)
* List and filter issues (by status, priority, tag, assignee)
* Search for issues using fuzzy matching
* Assign issues to users

### 🔹 Enhancements
* Sync with a remote PostgreSQL database
* Export issues as JSON/CSV for reporting
* Offline mode with local caching and auto-sync

### 🔹 Bonus Features
* GitHub/Jira integration (fetch issues from repositories)
* Webhook support for notifications
* Terminal UI mode for an interactive interface

### 📂 Project Structure (Golang Example)
```sh
/issue-tracker-cli
│── main.go            # CLI entry point
│── cmd/               # Command handlers (add, list, delete, sync)
│── internal/
│   ├── db.go          # Database handling (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
│   ├── storage.go     # Local file storage (JSON/YAML)
│   ├── sync.go        # Remote sync logic
│── ui/                # Terminal UI (if using bubbletea)
│── config.yaml        # Configuration settings
│── README.md          # Project documentation
```

### 🔧 Next Steps:
 * Set up a simple CLI structure using cobra (Golang) or commander.js (Node.js).
 * Implement basic issue CRUD operations (store locally in SQLite or JSON).
 * Add filtering, searching, and tagging features.
 * Build remote sync functionality with PostgreSQL.
 * (Optional) Enhance with a terminal UI or GitHub/Jira integration.

## 📌 Basic Commands
### ✅ Create an Issue

```sh
issue add -t "Fix login bug" -d "Users cannot log in with special characters" -p high -s open -a alice
```

 * -t: Title
 * -d: Description
 * -p: Priority (low, medium, high, critical)
 * -s: Status (open, in-progress, closed)
 * -a: Assign to user

### 📝 List Issues
```sh
issue list 
issue list -s open               # Show only open issues  
issue list -p high               # Show high-priority issues  
issue list -a alice              # Show issues assigned to Alice  
```

### 🔍 Search for Issues
```sh
issue search "login bug"
issue search -t "UI glitch"       # Search by title  
issue search -d "performance"     # Search in description  
```

### ✏️ Edit an Issue
```sh
issue edit 42 -t "Fix login error" -p critical -s in-progress
```

* 42 is the issue ID
* Updates the title, priority, and status

### ❌ Delete an Issue
```sh
issue delete 42
issue delete --all-closed       # Delete all closed issues  
```

### 📌 Tagging, Filtering, and Organizing
#### 🏷️ Tag an Issue
```sh
issue tag 42 -a "backend" -a "security"
```
 * -a: Add tags
 * Use -r to remove a tag

```sh
issue tag 42 -r "security"
```

### 📌 Change Issue Status
```sh
issue close 42
issue reopen 42
issue move 42 -s in-progress
```

### 📌 Sync & Export
#### 🔄 Sync with Remote Database
```sh
issue sync          # Sync local issues with remote PostgreSQL  
issue sync --push   # Force push local changes  
issue sync --pull   # Fetch latest issues from remote  
```

### 📤 Export Issues
```sh
issue export -f json > issues.json
issue export -f csv > issues.csv
```

### 📌 Advanced (Optional)
#### 🔗 Fetch Issues from GitHub/Jira
```sh
issue import github --repo "org/project"
issue import jira --project "DEV"
```

### 🔔 Enable Webhook Notifications
```sh
issue webhook add "http://myserver.com/webhook"
issue webhook list
issue webhook remove 1
```

### 📌 Bonus
#### Interactive Mode (if you add a TUI interface):
```sh
issue ui
```

Show issue details in a formatted table:
```sh
issue show 42
```
